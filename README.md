## Origin

Casetext was founded in 2013 by Jake Heller, Laura Safdie, and Pablo Arredondo. 
Since then, it has gone through 7 rounds of funding, the last one on Jan 7, 
2022.

Heller observed that there were many industries in which technology made things 
simpler, and wanted to bring that to legal firms.


>We knew that the technology to do relatively trivial stuff like find nearby
restaurants or good reviews of them or what have you was there. And it just
felt like this big disconnect where things that really mattered at the end of
the day, like whether or not somebody spends their life in prison &mdash; technology
wasn't really helping there.

*&mdash; Jake Heller, in his interview with Y Combinator President Garry Tan*


## Overview

Casetext started out as a crowdsourced solution for legal questions, similar to 
Wikipedia or Stack Overflow. Lawyers and paralegals could go over the same
documents, make annotations, and up- or down-vote and reply to those 
annotations.

In 2016, Casetext launched CARA AI. Users could upload case files to CARA to 
perform advanced searches on the uploaded text, powered by a rudimentary AI.

In 2023, Casetext leveraged OpenAI's GPT-4 to launch CoCounsel, a much more
powerful tool that will allow users to summarize and extract data from legal
documents, answer questions about contract compliance, and prepare for
depositions, among other tasks. This allowed lawyers to do in 10-15 minutes
what would once have taken several days.

Casetext has put up "guardrails" around these tasks to ensure the reliability
and quality of CoCounsel's responses. These safeguards can be manually disabled
by users to interact with CoCounsel in a more conversational manner like how
Chat GPT is used, with the understanding that it may result in less accurate 
responses.

## Growth

Since inception, Casetext's 10,000+ customers have submitted over 14 million 
queries. Their clients include *Fisher Phillips, LLP*, *Washington Legal,
LLP*, and *The California Innocence Project*.


### Acquisition

The company was recently acquired by
[Thomson Reuters](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en.html) in August 2023, for
$650M.

## Competition

[Harvey](https://www.harvey.ai/) is another company that aims to offer AI-based 
legal services. Harvey also uses Open AI's tools, but the company seems to be
in the early stages and not yet ready to take on new clients.

## Expansion

The guardrails built into Casetext's CoCounsel tool is an invaluable feature
that boosts users' confidence in the quality of the results.

Building on top of this reliablity, Casetext could launch an inter-state legal guide tool. Since traffic laws differ from state to state, an individual could 
use this to educate themselves on the differences in traffic laws between their home state and their destination state. If they happen to be driving, this could also outline the different laws to take note of when passing through each of the
states on their travel route.

Since legislation always lags behind technological advancements, such a tool
could also incorporate any court rulings around any new transportation methods,
such as the electronic scooter when it first came out.

This expands their user base from law firms to the general public. While this
new tool might need to be free to encourage adoption, the data gathered from
its use may drive improvements in both itself and CoCounsel, ultimately
improving the value of services they provide to the legal industry.
